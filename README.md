# 上清华!
Chinese version of GetTHU, which is a small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) by Gabrielle Cirulli and [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Based on GetMIT by MITchell Gu; inspired by Get Caltech! by Naveen Arun.

Made just for fun; no hard feelings to other colleges! [Play it here!](http://tnardyherif.github.io/GetTHU-zh/)
